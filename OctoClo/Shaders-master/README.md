# Shaders

This is a **personal ongoing project** in which I code shaders in Unity.

I had a lot of fun discovering and understanding them in a student project during the last summer vacations ([OctopusProject](https://github.com/OctoClo/OctopusProject)), so I decided to continue learning how to code shaders.

Here are some examples:
